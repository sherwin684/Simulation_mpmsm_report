abstract="Miscible multiphasic materials like classical mixtures as well as immiscible materials like saturated and partially saturated porous media can be successfully described on the common basis of the well-founded Theory of Mixtures (TM) or the Theory of Porous Media (TPM). In particular, both the TM and the TPM provide an excellent frame for a macroscopic description of a broad variety of engineering applications and further problems in applied natural sciences. The present article portrays both the standard and the micropolar approaches to multiphasic materials reflecting their mechanical and their thermodynamical frameworks. Including some constitutive models and various illustrative numerical examples, the article can be understood as a reference paper to all the following articles of this volume on theoretical, experimental and numerical investigations in the Theory of Porous Media.",

abstract="In general, many solids show an internal structure. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that several solids consist of different solid components, such as dense concrete without pores. On the other hand, solids can contain closed and open pores, such as ceramics and soils, as well as concrete. In the past, these materials were, in general, treated as one-component materials lacking an internal structure. Using such a model --- one which consists of an ideal material classical continuum mechanics has been very successful. All defined mechanical terms (for example, stress) are thereby understood as average quantities. Classical continuum mechanics can therefore not answer questions concerning the change of pores and the different motions belonging to the phases of liquid-saturated porous solids.",

abstract="In many branches of engineering, for example, in chemical engineering, material science, and soil mechanics, as well as in biomechanics, the different reactions of material systems undergoing external and/or internal loadings must be studied and described precisely in order to be able to predict the responses of these systems. Subsequently, the most important point of the investigation is to determine first the composition of the body, because one must know the physically and chemically differing materials that constitute the system under consideration. The material systems (or bodies) in these fields of engineering can be composed in various ways. On the one hand, solids can consist of different solid components, such as dense concrete, without considerable pores. On the other hand, solids can contain closed and open pores, such as ceramics and soils, as well as concrete. The pores can be filled with fluids and, due to the different material properties and the different motions, there may be interaction between the constituents. As was mentioned in Section 1, this fact makes the description of the mechanical (or the thermodynamic) behavior difficult.",
